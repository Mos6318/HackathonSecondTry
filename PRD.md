**The Problem:**
I need a compelling way to present my work and unique style of thinking to hiring managers and companies. A standard resume doesn't capture my full potential or "vibe."

Additionally, due to the challenging economic climate and significantly fewer open positions, it is imperative to establish strong Unique Selling Points (USPs) to stand out from the competition and get chosen for a role. **Specifically, I am targeting UX Design positions within Gaming Studios**, so the portfolio must reflect a strong understanding of gamer aesthetics and interactive design.
